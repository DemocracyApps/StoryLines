# Storylines
This is the documentation for StoryLines.

## Basic Concepts

When we wish to convey information to some sort of audience, a common approach is to present it as a logical sequence of discrete chunks of information, typically some text and images, as in a traditional slide presentation. Done well, the sequence is organized to tell a story in a way that engages the audience and helps them to make sense of the overall message or topic. Such a sequential set of information blocks is the simplest sort of storyline.

However, when the audience consists of a single user and that person can interact with the presentation, we may wish to modify the sequence based on what she tells us. This allows us to throw out irrelevant parts of the presentation and tailor the story we are telling to this particular person. In this case the particular storyline is generated from a larger structure with branches based on information the user provides or choices the user makes.

Creating and presenting such interactive storylines is the purpose of the StoryLines set of tools.
