# Card Editor
We'll want a basic card editor for this system, but this is one of the places that it would be great to have others provide more.

At minimum we'll use a WYSIWYG plugin like <a href="https://www.tinymce.com/" target="_blank">TinyMCE</a>. We'll need to write plugins for it to handle input and output controls and to allow some events that are filtered out by default to be specified.
