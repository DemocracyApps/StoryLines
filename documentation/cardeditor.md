# Card Editor
We'll want a basic card editor for this system, but this is one of the places that it would be great to have others provide more.

At minimum we'll use some WYSIWYG plugin like <a href="https://www.tinymce.com/" target="_blank">TinyMCE</a>. We'll need to write plugins for it to handle input and output controls.

The card editor must also support managing cardsets.

Since something like this could be used to create presentations as well, we may want to have in mind Abhi Nemani's requirements <a href="https://medium.com/@abhinemani/we-deserve-better-presentation-software-a-pitch-1ec9e2a8a57#.ji4oxcfv8" target="_blank">here</a>.
