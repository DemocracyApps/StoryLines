# Card Provider

This is just a stub for now, but I think we should have cards served by either by the current data server service or, more likely, by a separate cardserver service. It should be separate from the CBE.

We also need a local version that lets a developer (or presenter) create a story flow and cards on a laptop without the need for any server components.
