# Presenter
This is relatively straightforward, once all the other elements are in place.

Note that we want to be able to run this not only off a website, but locally on a laptop. We'll set it up to run through Node initially, which works fine from a development perspective, but not usable by others in the long term.

Note that a key requirement for the presenter is that it needs to be easy to include in third-party sites. Iframing in is one simple way, but it would be good to allow it be integrated into other code as well.
